# Get Functional

This repo is used for my talk `Let's Get Functional with Elixir`. The KJV word counting example is accomplished with the `flow_count` and `stream_count` in the `GetFunctionalFlow` module.

The slides are located in the `Presentation` folder on the `master` branch.

Also, check out [my talks page](http://taylonr.com/talks/539-2/) as a video of the course will eventually be posted there.
